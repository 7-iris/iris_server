# Iris

A self hosted notification server without google cloud messaging or firebase cloud messaging.

## Motivation
The driving force behind this project is my need for a tool that:
- Notifies the user when something is happening in a service/application.
- The user can deploy it in her/his premises.
- Uses a self hosted and open source message broker and not an external one.
